```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

- Steps:  
1. Sample QC (extract samples with European ancestry, merge across batches). 
2. SNP QC (allele count>10, INFO>0.3; Remove multi-allelic SNPs and InDels; update rsID). 
  
Please download the .vcf files from EGA and put them in "./9_sc_eQTL/data/genotype/vcf/" to replicate the analysis.
